# Contribuiting

## How to contribute

<br/>

1. Fork the repository

2. Create a branch for your feature

```bash
git checkout -b branch-name
```

3. Commit your changes

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

4. Push to the branch

```bash
git push origin branch-name
```

5. Open a Pull Request


<br/>

## Commit messages

Use __short__ and __descriptive__ commit messages.

Your commits should be __prefixed with the type of change you are making__, and should reference other commits if necessary by using their _short hash_.

Your commits should also include a description if the changes are not self-explanatory.

<br/>

#### Commit message types

- `refactor:` For structural changes to the code that __do not__ affect behavior.

- `fix:` For bug fixes.

- `feat:` For new features.

- `docs:` For documentation changes.

- `style:` For changes regarding the overall design of the website (_**e.g:** CSS_ files or _HTML_ structure).

- `script:` For changes regarding the scripts (_**e.g:** JavaScript_ files).

#### Pull request structure

Your pull requests must also be prefixed with the type of change you are making, and should contain a description for why those changes are being made (if the _PR_ tittle is not self-explanatory).

Happy Coding! :smile:
