## Running

Given the CORS policies of some browsers, we were having problems loading local JS files. To solve this, we created a simple Python script that launches a web server and opens the browser automatically on the website. To start the server,
run the following command:

```bash
python start.py
```

Alternatively, you can simply launch a live server instance within VSCode or any other IDE that supports it.
